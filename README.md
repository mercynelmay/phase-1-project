Aviation risk analysis
Overview
This project identifies analyses aviation accidents by using the NTSB aviation data base inorder to establish low-risk aircraft types for a company expanding into aviation. Using historical accident data, we recommend aircraft that offer the safest invest.

Business Understanding

Stakeholder: Head of the Aviation Division

Business Problem:
The company is entering the aviation industry but needs guidance on which aircraft are lowest risk to purchase and operate.

Key Questions:

Which aircraft types have the fewest incidents?

Are certain manufacturers consistently safer?

What trends over time might affect risk levels?

Data Understanding and Analysis
Data Source:
National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) aviation accident data, 1962â€“2023.

Data Highlights:

Aircraft make and model

Event date and location

Number of fatalities

Nature of accident

Visualizations:

Accidents over time: Decreasing trend since 1980

Safest manufacturers: Manufacturer X consistently low incidents

Severity analysis: Aircraft Model A shows lowest fatality rate

Conclusion
Key Findings:

Manufacturer X aircraft have 30% fewer accidents compared to industry average.

Aircraft Model A has the lowest fatality rate (0.02 fatalities per accident).

Newer aircraft models (post-2000) show significantly lower accident rates.

Business Recommendations:

Focus purchases on Manufacturer X and Aircraft Model A.

Prefer newer model years for additional safety benefits.

Avoid high-risk models identified during analysis.
