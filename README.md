Aircraft Safety Analysis for Acquisition Decisions

Project Overview

This project identifies and analyses aviation accidents by using the NTSB aviation data base inorder to establish low-risk aircraft types for a company expanding into aviation. Using historical accident data, we recommend aircraft that offer the safest invest.

Business Understanding

Objectives Our main goal is to be able to predict the accident severity based other factors in the NTSB database and find the aircraft model with the lowest risks .

Business Problem

 The company is entering the aviation industry but needs guidance on which aircraft has the lowest risk to purchase and operate.

Business Questions:

Which aircraft types have the fewest incidents?
Are there trends over time that affect risk?
Are certain manufacturers consistently safer?

Data Understanding and Analysis

Data Source:

we will get our aviation data from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) aviation accident data, 1962â€“2023.

Data Highlights:

Aircraft make and model
Event date and location
Number of fatalities
Nature of accident

Visualizations:

Accidents over time: Decreasing trend since 1980
Safest manufacturers: Manufacturer X consistently low incidents
Severity analysis: Aircraft Model A shows lowest fatality rate

Conclusion Key Findings:

Manufacturer X aircraft have fewer accidents compared to industry average.
Aircraft Model A has the lowest fatality rate
Newer aircraft models (post-2000) show significantly lower accident rates.

Business Recommendations:

Focus purchases on Manufacturer X and Aircraft Model A.
Prefer newer model years for additional safety benefits.
Avoid high-risk models identified during analysis.
